The **Plant Watering Reminder** app helps users manage their plant care by tracking watering schedules. Users can add plants, set watering frequencies, and mark them as watered. The app uses Local Storage to store plant data, ensuring the information persists even after page reloads. ðŸ’§

**Why I Chose This Project:**

I chose this project to combine practicality with creativity. Many people struggle to remember when to water their plants, so creating an app that makes plant care easier felt rewarding. Itâ€™s a simple but effective solution for plant lovers to stay organized and keep their plants healthy!
